## Welcome!

**Fizmoo** is NodeJS command-line interface (CLI) framework that drastically simplifies the creation & authoring process by dynamically generating commands from files in your file system. Each file exports specific constants that can be statically typed to easily define and reliable access command options and args.

Designed to drastically simplify the NodeJS CLI developer experience (DX), **Fizmoo** removes the need for complex architecture, inheritance and murky rules. You can statically and reliably define your options, args, and command definitions which creates an easily readable, ingestible and scalable mechanism for creating CLIs at scale.; Fizmoo makes it dead simple to create complex CLIs at scale. The only thing you need to do is create files.
